What the title implies, this is a program that contains 2 calculation/utility tools and 1 demonstration attempting to showcase a small part of the inner workings of a game I've been enjoying lately. 
To my instructor: Expect a video demonstration to be added to this repository within the next 24 hours. It is currently 11:25 PM on 12/4/2025 as I am typing this.
